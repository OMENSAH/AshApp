				<h1>Message from President</h1>
		<img src="Esther.jpg" style="float:right; width:100px;">
		<p>
	“We must challenge ourselves to be the ones who will change this content. We will be the beautiful ones that this continent needs and we must have the conviction that we can do it.” These profound words spoken by Dr. Patrick Awuah describe the conviction with which I believe we can take step towards fostering a deeper sense of unity within the student body. 

	Next year Ashesi will welcome its first batch of engineering students, ushering us into the Second Phase of our journey. We believe it is important that we review the structures we currently have in place to ensure that they join a thriving community. In doing this, we have decided to take a critical look at one of our three pillars; citizenship.

	We hope to build a strong Ashesi culture in which we can bond better with each other while appreciating the diversity amongst us. Our vision is to foster a deeper sense of unity through an Ashesi Culture even as we sustain and improve upon the great initiatives that have been started by past student governments. We have the conviction that together, we can do this as a community. And we will.

Esther’s vision is to lead the student body to form a deeper sense of unity and community. In her words, “Ashesi University College is bigger than aesthetic architecture, beautifully designed lecture halls, or the beautiful campus; Ashesi University College is the student body. It is about the citizenship of people from different countries, different cultures, different family backgrounds-it is about us, the students. This is the why we seek to take advantage of Ashesi’s pillar of citizenship in creating an Ashesi Culture.”</p>

			<h1>Examination Honour Code </h1>
			<p>In keeping with Ashesi’s mission to educate a new generation of ethical leaders, the faculty and executives of Ashesi University approved in November 2007 a proposal to formally invite selected classes at Ashesi to adopt an Honour Code for examinations at the university.
<br>
The code was voted into force by students in January 2008. Also effective January 2008, all incoming first year and transfer students will be required to sign on to the Examination Honour Code prior to admission to the university, and will receive extensive orientation about the code.

				<h1>Mission</h1>
	<p>The mission of Ashesi University College is to educate a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders in Africa; to cultivate within our students the critical thinking skills, the concern for others and the courage it will take to transform a continent. </p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
        <h1>Vision</h1>
  <p>Imagine if every Sub-Saharan African country had several small liberal-arts colleges, dedicated to nurturing critical thinking, effective communication skills, practical experience, and a true concern for society in their students. Such a development in Africa would make a tremendous positive impact on the continent. This is our vision: An African Renaissance driven by a new generation of ethical entrepreneurial leaders.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
        <h1>The Foundation</h1>
  <p>Ashesi University Foundation was founded in August 1999 and is spearheaded by a well-qualified Board of Trustees and management governance whose efforts are complemented by Advisory Boards located in the US and Ghana. The US Advisory Board is currently comprised of 25 academic advisors from some of the highest-ranking institutions in the United States: Swarthmore College, UC Berkeley and University of Washington. The Ghanaian Advisory Board comprises academics and business leaders in Ghana. Ashesi's Advisors have provided active input and guidance in our curriculum design process, and will continue to advise Ashesi on issues related to curriculum development, faculty and staff recruiting, exchange programs, and doing business in Ghana. To ensure that a rigorous academic standard is maintained, members of Ashesi's Business Advisory Councils at UC Berkeley, University of Washington and Swarthmore College have agreed to serve as external examiners.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
        <h1>The University</h1>
  <p>
  	Ashesi was established as an independent, co-educational, public benefit education institution operating on a not-for-profit basis. It was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee on 24th October 2001 and has been operating as such since its inception. The University gained accreditation from the National Accreditation Board of Ghana in September 2001, and began instruction with 30 students on 4th March 2002. The University offers four-year bachelor degrees in Business Administration, Computer Science and Management Information Systems, based on a Liberal Arts core curriculum that nurture ethical thinking and fosters critical thinking by teaching students to explore the connections between fields of knowledge, to separate relevant information from the irrelevant, to question assumptions, to reflect on the views of others. The Ashesi education teaches students to be problem solvers.
<br>
As a company limited by guarantee, the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179) and the University’s regulations require that all of Ashesi’s property and income are applied solely towards Ashesi’s educational mission. Ashesi is operated as a not-for-profit oriented entity, with one member; Ashesi University Foundation.
<br>
Ashesi admits students of all races colour, nationality, and ethnic origin to all its programs and makes available to these students all the rights and privileges; and the benefit of all programs and activities run by the university. The University does not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin in its admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs and in all other spheres of its operation.
<br>
The University has quickly gained a reputation for excellence in Ghanaian higher education. Over 95% of Ashesi’s graduates stay in Africa, working for efficiency, transparency and innovation in microfinance, technology, banking, NGOs and other areas. They improve the lives of fellow citizens and help grow Africa’s economy. Every Ashesi graduate, from our first class of ‘05, has found quality placement within months. African businesses and NGOs value their strong problem solving skills, pro-active approach, and ethical integrity.

        <h1>Meaning of Ashesi</h1>
  <p>
  <em><bold>If there is anything you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now</bold>.</em>
  <br><br>

These words by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe are the inspiration behind the university's name, Ashesi, which means "beginning" in Akan, a native Ghanaian language. Ashesi's founder, Patrick Awuah, first read Goethe's words at a time when he was still questioning the wisdom of undertaking such an ambitious project. Encouraged by Goethe's words, he began by undertaking a feasibility study of his idea. Clarifying the risks and issues at hand helped Awuah shed his reservations until one day he realized that he had lost his hesitation and had become very committed to this project. He then realized, "This really is the beginning!" But the name Ashesi is not only about its founder's inspiration. It is also about providing a new beginning for every student who comes to Ashesi. And about building an institution that reinvents itself to fit the changing needs of society, one that grows by replicating itself throughout Ghana and Africa.
